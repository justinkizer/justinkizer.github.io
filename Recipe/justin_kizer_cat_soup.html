    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Cat Soup is a peasant dish primarily consisting of fresh cat (mittens are optional, but preferred), with amputated human appendages often mixed in. This culinary delight was first created by sweatshop mogul, Frank Reynolds, as an inexpensive and readily available mainstay for his Vietnamese sweatshop workers.</p>

        <li>4 kitten mittens</li>
        <li>1 Star Anise (whole or ground)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Vietnamese peppercorns</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Cinnamon bark</li>
        <li>2 cups Curry leaves</li>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by heating a large stew pot to boiling (think: "the size of stew pot that Bugs Bunny always finds himself in")
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss cat (and/or kittens) into the pot, using your oversized ladle to stir and keep the cat/kittens from escaping or resurfacing for air
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the "ingredients" have stopped moving for at least one minute (ignore this step at your own peril!), relax your guard with the ladle and begin stirring in all of the spices
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the assorted human appendages to the broth (prefer whole appendages for a milder impact on the overall flavor, or minced appendages for a stronger flavor and a more uniform dispersion)
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to stir the soup for 10 minutes and serve immediately once finished (or whenever; whatever's easiest for you)
      </li>
      <li>
        This dish is best served in small dirty bowls (think: "Oliver Twist soup bowls" for size and style), and always with some of the soup running down the bowls' sides, on account of you wielding the serving ladle in a jubilantly reckless manner
      </li>
      <li>
        Profit - you're done! (as we never used the EGG, you can just put that on the dashboard of your car or on your desk when you go to work...it was just a jumping off point anyway; move past it!)
      </li>
    </ol>
