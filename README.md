# Robo-Tapper

As the sole-proprietor of the local Robot Saloon, you'll have to work quickly to ensure that all your customers are served before their thirst overtakes them...and they overtake you!

## Background

Tapper is a classic arcade game released in 1983 by Bally Midway, which originally required players to serve beer to unruly customers, before being rebranded shortly thereafter to Root Beer Tapper in 1984, at which time the alcoholic drinks were substituted with Root Beer.

The goal of the game is to slide drinks down the bar to all customers, who in turn slide a little bit down toward the exit doors with each received drink, until all customers have been "served" out of the building, at which time the level is complete and the player can restart. Customers continue to move slightly closer to the front of the bar when not being served.

The player can lose the level by:

 - Allowing any customer to reach the front of the bar (as the unruly and unserved customer will dispose of the player)

This implementation of Tapper, Robo-Tapper, also features a futuristic theme, in which the player and customers are robots in a Robot Saloon.

## Player Features:

  - Start and reset the game

  - Continue onto harder difficulties the longer the player stays on the level

  - Serve drinks to robots

  - Clean up empty steins

  - Be assaulted by unruly customers who reach the front of the bar without being served

## Technologies Used

HTML 5 Canvas, Vanilla JavaScript, and the Create.js library were used to implement this project.

## Bonus features

With time permitting, I'd like to also pursue the following additions to this project:

  - Add mini-game between levels, as included in the originals

  - Add additional levels, as related to the graphical background rather than difficulty

  - Add an intro that emulates the boot-up style of the classic arcade machines on which these were originally run
